A responsive marketing website recreated from a third-party mockup using HTML and CSS, featuring clean navigation, a strong call-to-action, and organized feature sections—demonstrating my ability to turn visual designs into fully functional interfaces.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img alt="HTML5 Badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML5-000000?style=flat&logo=HTML5"></a>

When starting this project, I focused first on building the structure so I had a clear understanding of the foundation before moving into styling. From what I gathered, the site was divided into three major sections, so I approached each one individually.

The first section included the navigation bar, which I aligned using floats to keep all the elements neatly positioned across the top. After setting up the navigation, I laid out the remaining elements normally and styled them with padding, margins, and spacing to maintain a clean, readable layout.

The second section required floating both the search bar area and the accompanying image to the right. Since the layout split the page evenly, I set each floated section to roughly 50% width. For the search bar itself, I floated the input field and button next to each other so they fit naturally together, then placed the text above and below them to match the original design.

The final section was more of a puzzle, but I approached it with basic layout logic. Each feature block had its own icon, text, and link contained inside a square. There were four features total, so I sized each feature box at around 23% width to allow just enough margin between them. This created even spacing and matched the original design while maintaining visual consistency.

## Optimizations
A small but important optimization involved the icons in features 1 and 3. The original icon for feature 3 wasn’t very clear and didn’t match the visual quality of the others—it looked unpolished and out of place. I initially added it, but it disrupted the aesthetic of the entire layout. To maintain consistency, I replaced it with the icon used in feature 1, since both features used circular icon styles. This small change made the entire section feel more cohesive, professional, and visually appealing.

## Lessons Learned:
Throughout this project, I learned how important it is to maintain consistent form factors across all elements, especially when designing for multiple screen sizes. I also became much more comfortable integrating images into floated layouts and learned to trust my intuition when making visual adjustments. Because there weren’t many references or examples available online, I often had to rely on careful observation and subtle tweaks to get everything just right. This experience helped sharpen my eye for layout details and strengthened my ability to interpret and recreate design mockups accurately.
